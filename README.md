# ATM Application

The application can be run with IntelliJ IDEA or Maven in terminal. Please run the sql scripts in ./database with MySQL to create database, which is required to run the application. 

For simple testing, you can use the following accounts included in the database
* admin account1: login:admin1, pincode:12345
* admin account2: login:admin2, pincode:12345

We have added unit tests, code coverage, and CI/CD in this repo to ensure a high quality codebase.
